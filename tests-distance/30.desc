check program with inputs -3.54 -1.91 and -2.46 -1.96

NOTE: Don't worry about the odd formatting in the tests.
This is a byproduct of the automated tests not actually
requiring input via the keyboard. Normally, the text we
type would appear in termal. You can run the same command
found in the .run files and you will see exactly what the
testing program will receive as output.
